AIANDMAS Exercises week 3


Exercise 1 (Blocks world - Russen & Norvig figure 10.3)

a) A non-interleaved planner cannot solve the are not subgoal independence


b) h_P*(s_0) = 3, since it takes three moves to satisfy all goals


c) h_gc(s_0) = 2, since there are two goals none of which are satisfied


d) 
Example of h_gc(s_0) = 1 and h*(s) ≥ 1000:
    A thousand blocks, where 999 of them are stacked correctly, but one that should be on the top is at the bottom
    Init( On(1, Table) & On(2, 3) & On(3, 4) & ... & On(n, 1) ) for n ≥ 1000
    

e) 
Example of h_gc(s_0) > h*(s):
    Init(On(A, Table), On(B, A) & ¬Clear(A))
    Goal(On(A, Table) & On(B, Table) & Clear(A) & Clear(B))

    0 B --> 0 0
    0 A --> B A


f) Determine h_ip(s_0) (the ignore preconditions and non-goal literal h) for fig 10.3:
    2 - since there are two goals none of which are satisfied?


g) Example of h_ip(s_0) where h_ip(s_0) = 1 and h*(s_0) ≥ 1000:
    Exactly the same as (d)


h) Since h_ip(s_0) is derived from a relaxation of the problem, it is admissible and always smaller than or equal to h*
    
    
i) Addition to atoms in initial state:
    & (A=A) & (B=B) & (C=C) & (Table=Table)


j) 
    NotEq(x,y) is introduced.
    Init: & NotEq(A,B) & NotEq(A,C) & NotEq(B,C)

    Move:
        Precond: & NotEq(A,B) & NotEq(A,C) & NotEq(B,C)


k) Determine h+(s_0):
    


l) 
    


m) 
    

n)
    

o)
    

p)
    

    h_add 
    - Doesn't hit the recursion?

q)
