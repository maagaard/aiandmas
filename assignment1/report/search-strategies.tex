It can seem like there are many more solutions, because of the now 4 A's, and not just one. However, only one of the A's can be pushed into the goal due to the ``Sobako ??????'' rule.
- So even with 8GB of RAM allocated it is not possible. 

Quite a few nodes have been explored.





Level:
The custom designed level is a derivation of SAD2, where some of the possible spaces are filled to limit the possible movements. The possible A's are also moved a little bit.
